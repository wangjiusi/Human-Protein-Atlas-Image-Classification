# Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification
Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification using fastai1.x

  In this Notebook, I want to explore as much information as possible from raw data (without external data). And refer to [*https://www.kaggle.com/iafoss/pretrained-resnet34-with-rgby-0-460-public-lb*](https://www.kaggle.com/iafoss/pretrained-resnet34-with-rgby-0-460-public-lb ) and [*Fastai v1 starter pack (Kernel edition)*](https://www.kaggle.com/hortonhearsafoo/fastai-v1-starter-pack-kernel-edition-lb-0-323), I learned a lot from them and great thanks. Eventually, I get 0.479 (public score). By the way, no focal loss function!
